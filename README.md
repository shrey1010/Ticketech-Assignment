## Usage

### Authentication

To access protected endpoints, users must be authenticated. This can be done by including the authentication token in the request headers.

### Endpoints

- `GET /todos/`: Retrieve a list of TODO items.
- `POST /todos/`: Create a new TODO item.
- `DELETE /todos/<id>/`: Delete a TODO item by its ID.
- `PUT /todos/<id>/`: Update the status of a TODO item by its ID.

## API Documentation

1. Access the API by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs/` in your web browser.

2. Authenticate (if required) using your credentials or token.

3. Explore and test the available endpoints.

### Swagger Documentation (Optional)

This project also provides Swagger documentation for the API, which offers a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing the endpoints.
